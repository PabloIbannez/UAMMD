---------------------------------

To increase the printf limit of a kernel:

    cudaDeviceGetLimit(size_t* size,cudaLimitPrintfFifoSize)
    cudaDeviceSetLimit(cudaLimitPrintfFifoSize, size_t size)
	
-------------------------------------------



If the code seems to crash or give strange behavior without a clear pattern
between runs (i.e. different results when running the same code, a dependency
of the code working or not depending of a previous run (which should be
independent obviously)) the problem usually comes from using a non
initialized array in a kernel.
EXPLANATION:
As the array gets allocated in a certain position in memory without
initialization, sometimes it might be filled with zeros (but most probably
will be filled with NaNs) and you are probably in luck and the code will
produce logical output.
When the correctness of the output appears to depend on a previous run
of the code (maybe with a certain set of parameters). Maybe, if the section
of memory happens to fall in a region initialized by a previous run the
non-initialized array is more likely to be in a somewhat
consistent state, probably filled with zeros. But it also might be filled with giberish!

--------------------------------------------------


CUDA doesnt like very much NaN or Inf, and the errors arising from performing
operations with them propagate in very unexpected and strange ways.

CUDA threads throw exceptions but the cuda core doesnt do anything about it until something explicitly tells it to. Like a thrust call or maybe a cudaDeviceSynchronize call. So if a kernel thros an exception and later in the code there is a thrust call. The error will appear to originate in the thrust code.


-------------------------------------------------------------


Be careful with the conversions between floats and ints. They are super tricky.
The precision of floating point values is very low (~7 digits) and this will cause you
headaches when trying to round them to integers in some extreme cases.

Uninitialized constant memory data defaults to zero!
